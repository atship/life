1, There are several times misspell the word, and bug occurs. 
    eg.
    <car
        name="newbie"
        qteTimer=".5"
    />
    <car
        name="good"
        qtetimer=".6"
    />
   the word "qteTimer" is not "qtetimer", don't trust yourself when you find that the same code causes different results.

2, The initializer is very important
    eg.
    defined a pointer in header file:
    Class* obj_;
    
    using the pointer in source file without initialize:
    if (obj_)
        obj_->DoSomething(); // will cause crash in windows system and android system.
    
    initialize it with 0, then the code would be ok, because it is empty, the system will skip it
    obj_ = 0;
